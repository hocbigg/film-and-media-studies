## How to use this curriculum

### The Core

These sections (I through VI) form the essential foundation. They give you the broad knowledge and key skills needed to understand film and media as an academic field.

Study them **in the exact order** listed below:

1. **I. Foundations of Film and Media Studies**  
   Start here. This introduces the basic concepts and ways of thinking about film and media.

2. **II. Historical Development of Media Forms**  
   Next, learn how cinema, television, and digital media developed over time.

3. **III. Core Analytical Frameworks**  
   This teaches you the main tools and methods for closely analyzing films and other media.

4. **IV. Media, Culture, and Society**  
   Now look at the bigger picture: how media connects to culture, power, audiences, and society.

5. **V. Research Methods in Film and Media Studies**  
   Learn the basic ways scholars investigate and write about media.

6. **VI. Media Production Foundations**  
   Finish the core with an introduction to how media is actually made (even if you never plan to produce anything yourself).


### Specialization Tracks

Section **VII. Specialization Tracks** contains four optional paths you can follow **after** finishing the Core (or at least the first four sections of the Core). You do **not** need to do all of them.

- **A. Production and Filmmaking** – for people who want to learn how to make films and videos  
- **B. Theory and Criticism** – for those who love deep analysis, writing reviews, and theoretical ideas  
- **C. Media and Society** – for people interested in media industries, politics, policy, and global impact  
- **D. Digital and New Media** – for those drawn to platforms, algorithms, internet culture, and emerging technologies
