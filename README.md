# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate degree in Film and Media Studies, condensed into 1–2 years of study at approximately 20 hours per week. It is designed in the style of the Open Source Society University (OSSU), emphasizing logical progression, prerequisites, and a balance of theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and synthetic application. The program is divided into four phases: Introduction, Core, Advanced, and Capstone. These phases can be mapped to a semester-like structure assuming 12–16 weeks per phase, allowing flexibility for 1 year (intensive pace) or 2 years (balanced pace).

- **Total Estimated Workload**: 1,000–2,000 hours, depending on pace and depth. Allocate ~20 hours/week across subjects in active phases, including reading, analysis, exercises, and projects.
- **Progression Logic**: Subjects build sequentially with clear prerequisites to ensure foundational skills are mastered before advancing. Theory is balanced with practice (e.g., analysis and creation), and synthesis occurs through milestones and the capstone.
- **Milestones**: Defined at phase transitions to assess readiness. These include self-evaluations, such as writing reflective essays or completing small projects.
- **Specialization Tracks**: In the Advanced phase, choose one track for deeper focus: (1) Production and Filmmaking (hands-on creation), (2) Theory and Criticism (analytical depth), (3) Media and Society (cultural and social impacts), or (4) Digital and New Media (emerging technologies). Tracks include 3–4 elective subjects each, allowing customization while maintaining breadth.

# Curriculum

## Phase 1: Introduction
This phase orients learners to the field, building basic literacy and historical context. Equivalent to the first semester of a traditional program. Complete in 12–16 weeks at 15–20 hours/week.
