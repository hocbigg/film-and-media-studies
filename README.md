# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate degree in Film and Media Studies, condensed into 1–2 years of study at approximately 20 hours per week. 

## Organization
The program is divided into four phases: Introduction, Core, Advanced, and Capstone.

- **Total Estimated Workload**: 1,000–2,000 hours, depending on pace and depth. Allocate ~20 hours/week across subjects in active phases, including reading, analysis, exercises, and projects.
- **Progression Logic**: Subjects build sequentially with clear prerequisites to ensure foundational skills are mastered before advancing. Theory is balanced with practice (e.g., analysis and creation), and synthesis occurs through milestones and the capstone.
- **Milestones**: Defined at phase transitions to assess readiness. These include self-evaluations, such as writing reflective essays or completing small projects.
- **Specialization Tracks**: Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it: 
    - (1) Production and Filmmaking (hands-on creation)
    - (2) Theory and Criticism (analytical depth)
    - (3) Media and Society (cultural and social impacts)
    - (4) Digital and New Media (emerging technologies).

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
