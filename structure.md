# Self-Study Program Roadmap for Film and Media Studies

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate degree in Film and Media Studies, condensed into 1–2 years of study at approximately 20 hours per week. It is designed in the style of the Open Source Society University (OSSU), emphasizing logical progression, prerequisites, and a balance of theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and synthetic application. The program is divided into four phases: Introduction, Core, Advanced, and Capstone. These phases can be mapped to a semester-like structure assuming 12–16 weeks per phase, allowing flexibility for 1 year (intensive pace) or 2 years (balanced pace).

- **Total Estimated Workload**: 1,000–2,000 hours, depending on pace and depth. Allocate ~20 hours/week across subjects in active phases, including reading, analysis, exercises, and projects.
- **Progression Logic**: Subjects build sequentially with clear prerequisites to ensure foundational skills are mastered before advancing. Theory is balanced with practice (e.g., analysis and creation), and synthesis occurs through milestones and the capstone.
- **Milestones**: Defined at phase transitions to assess readiness. These include self-evaluations, such as writing reflective essays or completing small projects.
- **Specialization Tracks**: In the Advanced phase, choose one track for deeper focus: (1) Production and Filmmaking (hands-on creation), (2) Theory and Criticism (analytical depth), (3) Media and Society (cultural and social impacts), or (4) Digital and New Media (emerging technologies). Tracks include 3–4 elective subjects each, allowing customization while maintaining breadth.
- **Adaptability**: This generic structure can be adapted by mapping open resources (e.g., lectures, readings) to subjects in later planning stages. Emphasize interdisciplinary connections, such as with history, sociology, or technology.

## Phase 1: Introduction (Orientation and Fundamentals)
This phase orients learners to the field, building basic literacy and historical context. Equivalent to the first semester of a traditional program. Complete in 12–16 weeks at 15–20 hours/week.

| Subject Name | Why Study? | Key Topics | Estimated Workload (hours/week) | Prerequisites |
|--------------|------------|------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| Introduction to Film and Media | To develop foundational understanding of film and media as art forms, industries, and cultural artifacts, enabling critical engagement with everyday media consumption. | Definitions of film and media; basic elements (e.g., mise-en-scène, editing, sound); overview of media evolution; introductory analysis techniques. | 10–12 | None |
| Media Literacy and Critical Viewing | To cultivate skills for discerning media messages, biases, and influences, fostering informed citizenship in a media-saturated world. | Media representation; propaganda and persuasion; audience reception; ethical considerations in media consumption. | 8–10 | None |

**Milestone**: After completing this phase, demonstrate basic proficiency through a short analytical essay on a selected film or media piece, identifying key elements and biases.

## Phase 2: Core (Essential Subjects)
This phase covers the breadth of the field, equivalent to the second and third years of a traditional program. Focus on building analytical, historical, and practical skills.

## Phase 3: Advanced (Elective Subjects and Specialization Tracks)
This phase allows specialization, equivalent to the final year of a traditional program. Select one track and complete its subjects, plus any cross-track electives for breadth. Complete in 12–16 weeks at 20 hours/week, focusing on deeper inquiry and synthesis.

Choose one specialization track:
